We’d like to recognize Hao for his exceptional and efficient work in developing four major modules within AIP—an impressive achievement given their complexity and impact. The Fraud module, newly added to the Planning Memo sections, enables users to search by Auditable Entities, improving accessibility and usability. The MT module supported the enterprise-wide rollout of the new GRCE Control Testing and Monitoring modules for F25, while also preserving access to legacy M&T records from F24. From the Ideation Group, Hao implemented two innovative ideas: the RAP View and the IAAP module. The RAP View provides summarized RAP data by Auditable Entity or Accountable Executive, with predefined filters to support RAP templates and streamline reporting. The IAAP module, built using web scraping, automates the download of key documents such as the Business Case and Financial Toolkit, along with the approval process. Now in UAT and on track for deployment, the IAAP module has already received positive feedback for delivering significant time savings and improving workflow efficiency.
